This proposed program constitutes my senior project for graduating from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA. This software provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for representing Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) or Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) sequences. Modules that are included in this application are; PAM Score analysis and comparison between sequences, Amino Acids and Proteins that the sequence can manufacture, and extended details on those compounds.
